# 🧟🏻‍♀️☣️ Zero to backend HERO! 🦸🏻‍♀️🚀

Welcome to my personal journey to mastering backend engineering and algorithms. This helps me track progress, stay accountable, and give back by sharing what I learn along the way.

This repository is a living archive of everything I'm learning and practicing to grow as a backend engineer. It includes:

- 📚 Notes on computer science fundamentals, system design, software architecture, clean code and SOLID
- 💡 Data structures and algorithms solved and explained
- 🧪 Testing, code quality and backend patterns in action
- 🛠️ Mini backend projects to apply key concepts
