---

## 📝 Overview

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.

"For me, great algorithms are the poetry of computation. Just like
verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious.
But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some
aspect of computing." — Francis Sullivan
